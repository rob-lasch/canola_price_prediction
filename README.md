# canola_price_prediction
Using ML and regression techniques to predict Canola futures for my families farm


The data gathering was rather crude. I was able to get production, fertilizer and pesticide data 
from https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-production. I retrieved the daily price data from 
https://www.investing.com/commodities/canola-futures-historical-data.  The weather data was tricky, I found this 
website, https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/cropview/commodityView.aspx?cropid=2226000 and picked areas with 
the most dense canola production and weighted them based on the country's production in that area. As you can see
in Canada is broken into Alberta and Saskatchewan.
